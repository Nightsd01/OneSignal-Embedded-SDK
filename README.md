# OneSignal-Embedded-SDK
This is an early stage open source C++ library for OneSignal, allowing you to send push notifications from microcontrollers like the ESP32 and ESP8266 (currently only these two MCUs are supported).

This library is in an early stage of development. 

TODO:
- Add tests and CI
- Expand support for more platforms like Arduino
- Use tests & lldb to verify there aren't any memory leaks
- Add error handling
- Add documentation
